# Mobile Phone Data and COVID-19
In this document, I discuss two articles about the collecation and usage of mobile phone data during the COVID-19 pandemic. I present and discuss two aspects on this important matter: mobile data for revealing the effect of social distancing on the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and for informing public health actions across it.

## Article 1
JAMA Network Open's [Mobile phone location data reveal the effect and geographic variation of social distancing on the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11430) employs large-scale anonymous mobile phone location data provided by Descartes Labs and SafeGraph to derive users' daily travel distance and stay-at-home time. With the data it is able to analyze the degree to which social distancing mandates have been followed in the U.S. and its effect on growth of COVID-19 cases. The paper reaches a conclusion that social distancing mandates reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are followed.

I am very impressed that this study builds a web-based mapping platform that integrates geographic information systems (GIS) and daily updated human mobility statistical patterns derived from large-scale smartphone location big data. This article demonstrates that effective collection and anlysis of data could help reveal scientific truth, increase public awareness on critical issues, and support governmental decision-makings. 

## Article 2
In addition to the findings made in JAMA Network Open's piece on the issue, Science Advances's [Mobile phone data for informing public health actions across the COVID-19 pandemic life cycle](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/23/eabc0764/) outlines more ways in which different types of mobile phone data can help to better target and design measures to contain and slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, very interestingly, the article also discusses why the use of mobile phone data remains relatively scarce for tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Among all the reasons listed, concerns regarding privacy, data protection and civil liberties might first appear as a common issue for all kinds of data-based applications. However, different from the normal commercial data collections, more comprehensive tracking of personal data in surveillance tools might be justified for the cause of pandemic. Such enhanced access to data by the governments and tech companies could then easily persist beyond emergency times and usages, and to the disadvantage of individual users.
